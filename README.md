# Introduction 👋
Welcome to virtmanager-win, this is a side project of mine where
the goal is to make a UI Frontend for QEMU on windows for VirtManager in Python\Cython
in QtQuick (QML) with PySide.
**keep in mind: this repo is a work in progress, as of right now it is just a simple hello world, why: because I am still learning Qt & QtQuick**

## AI Usage Policy
due to this project being developed by a Solo Developer, AI usage is limited to the following:

- AI is used to generate code snippets and documentation.
- AI is used to port minor components (command syntax like PowerShell, Bash, etc.)
- AI is used to generate boilerplate & utilities (makefiles, scripts, etc.)
- AI is not used to generate user interface designs or layouts.
- AI is not used to generate test cases or automated testing.
- AI is not used to fix or otherwise patch security vulnerabilities.
