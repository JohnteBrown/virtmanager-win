# Introduction 👋
Welcome to virtmanager-win, this is a side project of mine where
the goal is to make a UI Frontend for QEMU on windows for VirtManager in Python\Cython
in QtQuick (QML) with PySide.
**keep in mind: this repo is a work in progress, as of right now it is just a simple hello world, why: because I am still learning Qt & QtQuick, therfore the UI probably will not be fully structured or functional for the time being**
